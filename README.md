Punk Beer App is my take on the (in-course)Scrimba project of the same name with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The user is able to select the kind of beer they need using ABV and IBU as filters. They are also able to navigate through the several pages of items. Here are the Javascript methods implemented to make that happen:
* async & await
* fetch()
* addEventListener()
* querySelector()
* Switch statements
* Custom functions.
